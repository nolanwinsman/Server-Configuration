# TV/Movies that are Hard to Find

This is a list of TV shows and Movies that I had trouble finding Blu-Ray/DVDs of. I added a difficulty out of 10 for each show


#### Difficulty

The numbers are chosen quite arbitrarily.

- 1/10 means a little harder than auto search
- 5/10 basic manual import
- 8/10 hard to find, had to manually import carefully choosing each individual episode, or both.

Also some of these are marked as TVDB organizes these shows diffirently. For instance, Some shows have two episodes per episode and that isn't proerply indicated on Sonarr.

## TV

#### Found and Organized

- Baccano (2006) [9/10]
- Legend of the Galactic Heroes [9/10]
- Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden [9/10]
- Record of Lodoss War [6/10]
- Air Master [5/10]
- To be Hero X [2/10] 
- Panty & Stocking [3/10]
- Jack Black [4/10]
- Fighting Spirit (Hajime no Ippo) [2/10]
- Dragon Ball Z SoM Color Corrected [9/10]
    not hard to find but had to manually import most of the episodes.
- Zetman (2012) [10/10]
    had to convert `.m2ts` files to `.mkv` label the audio/subtitle tracks as english/japanese. Lastly, the filenames did not indicate what episodes they were so I had to watch each episode to see which one it is. 


#### Still Looking

This section is for tv shows that I am either still looking for a good blu ray or I'm missing certain episodes.

- Ace of Diamond
- Jack Black OVA (1993 2011)
