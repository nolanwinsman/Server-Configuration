# Ezarr Setup

Ezarr is a project built to make it EZ to deploy a Servarr mediacenter on an Ubuntu server. The
badge above means that the shell script and docker-compose file in this repository at least *don't
crash*. It doesn't necessarily mean it will run well on your system ;) 
It's set up to follow the [TRaSH guidelines](https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/How-to-setup-for/Docker/) so it should at least perform optimally.

## [Ezarr Forked Repo](https://github.com/nolanwinsman/ezarr)

I created my own fork of the Ezarr repository to change the code/settings for my personal preferences. All the changes are noted in the `README.md` of the fork above.
